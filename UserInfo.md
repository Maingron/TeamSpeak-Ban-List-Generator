# User information on why you can't use your nickname

Hey there! If you got here after receiving a ban message regarding an invalid nickname, I'll explain why:  

It's almost impossible to ban bad nicknames using TeamSpeaks own ban system. There are heavy limits on bannable characters, and especially the length of bannable nicknames. In order get the system to work over these limitations, a multi-layer approach has to be used. First of all, all uncommon fake-characters are banned. This is required to get the length of the ban-string in step 2 down.
Well, and step 2 is to ban all bad nicknames. This includes default nicknames, admin impersonation and just bad words in general.

**You can still connect to the server once you change your nickname!**

## Alternative letters
If you don't have access to standard letters, for whatever reason, here's verified valid letters, although others are also valid:
- ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
- abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
- 1234567890
- äöüß ÄÖÜ
